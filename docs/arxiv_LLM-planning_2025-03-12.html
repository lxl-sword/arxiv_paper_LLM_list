  Driving</a></h5>

<p class='card-text'>Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving holds great promise
for improving safety by addressing the perception and prediction uncertainties
inherent in single-agent systems. However, traditional cooperative methods are
constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to
unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized
reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable
inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To
address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline
LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based
negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel
driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module
under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies
through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an
intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into
executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based
simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios
for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11%
higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios.

<p class='card-text'>Developing autonomous home robots controlled by natural language has long
been a pursuit of human. While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and
embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the
lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation
methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation
trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce Embodied Mobile
Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), which requires agents to interpret
user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space.
EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a
unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment.
Additionally, we collect EMMOE-100, which features in various task attributes,
detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for
LLM training. Furthermore, we design HomieBot, a sophisticated agent system
consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted
navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms.
Finally, we demonstrate HomieBot's performance and the evaluation of different
models and policies.</p>

<p class='card-text'>While machine learning algorithms have been shown to excel at specific
chemical tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that
characterizes expert chemical reasoning, limiting their widespread adoption.
Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful
chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms,
enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert
thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we
leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search
algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm
through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and
mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists
to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that
satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs
guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical
principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance
across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly
sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for
computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with
the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more
intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-11 14:57:53</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered
significant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational
resource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task
planning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic
reasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance
of lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their
reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill
templates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function
calls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for
fine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before
generating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three
levels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal
consistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity
verification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls.
Additionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions,
thereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term
tasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which
comprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps.
Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate
despite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial
semantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent.
Moreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.</p>

<p class='card-text'>In recent years, research on humanoid robots has garnered increasing
attention. With breakthroughs in various types of artificial intelligence
algorithms, embodied intelligence, exemplified by humanoid robots, has been
highly anticipated. The advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
have significantly improved the motion control and generalization capabilities
of humanoid robots. Simultaneously, the groundbreaking progress in large
language models (LLM) and visual language models (VLM) has brought more
possibilities and imagination to humanoid robots. LLM enables humanoid robots
to understand complex tasks from language instructions and perform long-term
task planning, while VLM greatly enhances the robots' understanding and

\textcolor{magenta}{Trinity}, a novel AI system for humanoid robots that

<p class='card-text'>Autonomous navigation in open-world outdoor environments faces challenges in
integrating dynamic conditions, long-distance spatial reasoning, and semantic
understanding. Traditional methods struggle to balance local planning, global
planning, and semantic task execution, while existing large language models
(LLMs) enhance semantic comprehension but lack spatial reasoning capabilities.
Although diffusion models excel in local optimization, they fall short in
large-scale long-distance navigation. To address these gaps, this paper
proposes KiteRunner, a language-driven cooperative local-global navigation
strategy that combines UAV orthophoto-based global planning with diffusion
model-driven local path generation for long-distance navigation in open-world
scenarios. Our method innovatively leverages real-time UAV orthophotography to
construct a global probability map, providing traversability guidance for the
local planner, while integrating large models like CLIP and GPT to interpret
natural language instructions. Experiments demonstrate that KiteRunner achieves
5.6% and 12.8% improvements in path efficiency over state-of-the-art methods in

<p class='card-text'>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) opens new frontiers for
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), yet existing systems remain confined to
predefined tasks due to hardware-software co-design challenges. This paper
presents the first aerial intelligent agent capable of open-world task

limitations: (1) Onboard LLM operation via an edge-optimized computing
platform, achieving 5-6 tokens/sec inference for 14B-parameter models at 220W
peak power; (2) A bidirectional cognitive architecture that synergizes slow
deliberative planning (LLM task planning) with fast reactive control (state
estimation, mapping, obstacle avoidance, and motion planning). Validated
through preliminary results using our prototype, the system demonstrates
reliable task planning and scene understanding in communication-constrained

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in
reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence
of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written
reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating
complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it
is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning
scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly
improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate
low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks.
  To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot
in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of
three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list
generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor):
(1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was
measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and
execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with
chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation
for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding,
we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance
performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Ensuring safe, comfortable, and efficient planning is crucial for autonomous
driving systems. While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well
in standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events.
Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs)
advancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational
inefficiency. Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and
Slow", we propose $\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that
synergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module. The
fast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory
generation in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through
uncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario
resolution. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic
switching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time
uncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan
feedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A
bidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's
reasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making. To
strengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled
with reward-instruct training strategy. In open-loop experiments, FASIONAD
achieves a $6.7\%$ reduction in average $L2$ trajectory error and $28.1\%$

<p class='card-text'>Enabling humanoid robots to perform long-horizon mobile manipulation planning
in real-world environments based on embodied perception and comprehension
abilities has been a longstanding challenge. With the recent rise of large
language models (LLMs), there has been a notable increase in the development of
LLM-based planners. These approaches either utilize human-provided textual
representations of the real world or heavily depend on prompt engineering to
extract such representations, lacking the capability to quantitatively
understand the environment, such as determining the feasibility of manipulating
objects. To address these limitations, we present the Instruction-Augmented
Long-Horizon Planning (IALP) system, a novel framework that employs LLMs to
generate feasible and optimal actions based on real-time sensor feedback,
including grounded knowledge of the environment, in a closed-loop interaction.
Distinct from prior works, our approach augments user instructions into PDDL
problems by leveraging both the abstract reasoning capabilities of LLMs and
grounding mechanisms. By conducting various real-world long-horizon tasks, each
consisting of seven distinct manipulatory skills, our results demonstrate that
the IALP system can efficiently solve these tasks with an average success rate
exceeding 80%. Our proposed method can operate as a high-level planner,
equipping robots with substantial autonomy in unstructured environments through

<p class='card-text'>Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has
unlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety
concerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to
adversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in
real-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the
novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the
physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In
this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure
the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined
safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust
LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety
specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves
potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a
possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures
safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive
simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking
attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans
from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also
demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive
attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to
perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to
mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalizable reasoning
and planning capabilities. However, their efficacies in spatial path planning
and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs
for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle
unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control
across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and
humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we
explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by
constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we
represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling
movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and
practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive
for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner,
modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles
while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the
target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent
interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in
multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional

<p class='card-text'>In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant
promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is
observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not
accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ
predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts
and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged,
where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite
their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to
insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we introduce InversePrompt, a novel
self-corrective task planning approach that leverages inverse prompting to
enhance interpretability. Our method incorporates reasoning steps to provide
clear, interpretable feedback. It generates inverse actions corresponding to
the initially generated actions and verifies whether these inverse actions can
restore the system to its original state, explicitly validating the logical
coherence of the generated plans. The results on benchmark datasets show an

<p class='card-text'>Fact-checking plays a crucial role in combating misinformation. Existing
methods using large language models (LLMs) for claim decomposition face two key
limitations: (1) insufficient decomposition, introducing unnecessary complexity
to the verification process, and (2) ambiguity of mentions, leading to
incorrect verification results. To address these challenges, we suggest
introducing a claim graph consisting of triplets to address the insufficient
decomposition problem and reduce mention ambiguity through graph structure.
Based on this core idea, we propose a graph-based framework, GraphFC, for
fact-checking. The framework features three key components: graph construction,
which builds both claim and evidence graphs; graph-guided planning, which
prioritizes the triplet verification order; and graph-guided checking, which
verifies the triples one by one between claim and evidence graphs. Extensive
experiments show that GraphFC enables fine-grained decomposition while
resolving referential ambiguities through relational constraints, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across three datasets.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Data Science tasks are multifaceted, dynamic, and often domain-specific.
Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases,
neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting
their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent,
a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user,
agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code
cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a
Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including
DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering.
Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution
space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and
accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The
self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by
diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive
experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data
modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results
highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the
groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by
disrupting environmental understanding. Current protocols typically respond
with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and
lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose
LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like
driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO
features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action
condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact
with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware
control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents.
To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit,
a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects,
complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA
simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve
driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous
driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show
that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements
instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-10 07:40:01</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In autonomous exploration tasks, robots are required to explore and map
unknown environments while efficiently planning in dynamic and uncertain
conditions. Given the significant variability of environments, human operators
often have specific preference requirements for exploration, such as
prioritizing certain areas or optimizing for different aspects of efficiency.
However, existing methods struggle to accommodate these human preferences
adaptively, often requiring extensive parameter tuning or network retraining.
With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been
widely applied to text-based planning and complex reasoning, their potential
for enhancing autonomous exploration is becoming increasingly promising.
Motivated by this, we propose an LLM-based human-preferred exploration
framework that seamlessly integrates a mobile robot system with LLMs. By
leveraging the reasoning and adaptability of LLMs, our approach enables
intuitive and flexible preference control through natural language while
maintaining a task success rate comparable to state-of-the-art traditional
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively
bridges the gap between human intent and policy preference in autonomous
exploration, offering a more user-friendly and adaptable solution for

<p class='card-text'>Query optimization is a critical task in database systems, focused on
determining the most efficient way to execute a query from an enormous set of
possible strategies. Traditional approaches rely on heuristic search methods
and cost predictions, but these often struggle with the complexity of the
search space and inaccuracies in performance estimation, leading to suboptimal
plan choices. This paper presents LLMOpt, a novel framework that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges through two innovative
components: (1) LLM for Plan Candidate Generation (LLMOpt(G)), which eliminates
heuristic search by utilizing the reasoning abilities of LLMs to directly
generate high-quality query plans, and (2) LLM for Plan Candidate Selection
(LLMOpt(S)), a list-wise cost model that compares candidates globally to
enhance selection accuracy. To adapt LLMs for query optimization, we propose
fine-tuning pre-trained models using optimization data collected offline.
Experimental results on the JOB, JOB-EXT, and Stack benchmarks show that
LLMOpt(G) and LLMOpt(S) outperform state-of-the-art methods, including
PostgreSQL, BAO, and HybridQO. Notably, LLMOpt(S) achieves the best practical
performance, striking a balance between plan quality and inference efficiency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Robotics researchers increasingly leverage large language models (LLM) in
robotics systems, using them as interfaces to receive task commands, generate
task plans, form team coalitions, and allocate tasks among multi-robot and
human agents. However, despite their benefits, the growing adoption of LLM in
robotics has raised several safety concerns, particularly regarding executing
malicious or unsafe natural language prompts. In addition, ensuring that task
plans, team formation, and task allocation outputs from LLMs are adequately
examined, refined, or rejected is crucial for maintaining system integrity. In
this paper, we introduce SafePlan, a multi-component framework that combines
formal logic and chain-of-thought reasoners for enhancing the safety of
LLM-based robotics systems. Using the components of SafePlan, including Prompt
Sanity COT Reasoner and Invariant, Precondition, and Postcondition COT
reasoners, we examined the safety of natural language task prompts, task plans,
and task allocation outputs generated by LLM-based robotic systems as means of
investigating and enhancing system safety profile. Our results show that
SafePlan outperforms baseline models by leading to 90.5% reduction in harmful

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their role
in robotic task planning. However, while LLMs have been explored for generating
feasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains
underdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception,
making them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency
hazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a
Graphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based
decision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a
dynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk
factors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike
existing methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework
introduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines
safety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more
flexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive
safety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct
experiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates
improvements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task

<p class='card-text'>Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable
energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power
forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while
significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency
and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems'
spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional
methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather
prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller
DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large
language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to
improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By
reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language
modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then
Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by
leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance
between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear
projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the
final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms
leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as
Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in
both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates
exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the
application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable
solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve
real-world forecasting accuracy.</p>

their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease

under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities
of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based
agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating
reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters,
response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To
ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages
Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with
structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical

Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21
primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed
to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was
non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist
physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and

clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a
multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies
(US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both
benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE

reasoning capabilities of LLMs, driving research into commonsense, numerical,
logical, and qualitative reasoning. However, with the rapid progress of
reasoning-focused models such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, there has been
a growing demand for reasoning benchmarks that can keep pace with ongoing model
developments. In this paper, we introduce MastermindEval, a simple, scalable,
and interpretable deductive reasoning benchmark inspired by the board game
Mastermind. Our benchmark supports two evaluation paradigms: (1) agentic
evaluation, in which the model autonomously plays the game, and (2) deductive
reasoning evaluation, in which the model is given a pre-played game state with
only one possible valid code to infer. In our experimental results we (1) find
that even easy Mastermind instances are difficult for current models and (2)
demonstrate that the benchmark is scalable to possibly more advanced models in
the future Furthermore, we investigate possible reasons why models cannot
deduce the final solution and find that current models are limited in deducing
the concealed code as the number of statement to combine information from is
