<p class='card-text'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing
landscape and brought to life diverse applications. Pretraining on vast
web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research
community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to
achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic
foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge,
improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with
user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,
and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs
performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various
real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of
post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond
pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward
hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in
model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline
future research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually
track developments in this fast-evolving field:

<p class='card-text'>Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs).
To amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context
training, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data
partitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training
frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish
static communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a
2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no
matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch
between data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and
imbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.
  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable
LLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short
sequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid
Data Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning
with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,
which eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware
sharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication
cost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a
balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware
data assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to
141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more
than 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the
state-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for LLM alignment and
reasoning, but existing policy-based methods, such as PPO and DPO, can fall
short of fixing shortcuts inherited from pre-training. In this work, we
introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides
the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to
learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online
dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using
unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably
learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically,
$Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while
maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we
establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning,
providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability.
Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and
converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our
results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs,
offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees. The code can be

<p class='card-text'>Mainstream issue-resolving frameworks predominantly rely on commercial
models, leading to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing training
approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to
fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented
Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue
resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured
subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code
edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using
ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement
learning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the
SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve
21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B). The experimental
results demonstrate that SoRFT significantly enhances issue-resolving
performance, improves model generalization, and provides a cost-efficient
alternative to commercial models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Goal-oriented de novo molecule design, namely generating molecules with
specific property or substructure constraints, is a crucial yet challenging
task in drug discovery. Existing methods, such as Bayesian optimization and
reinforcement learning, often require training multiple property predictors and
struggle to incorporate substructure constraints. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose ChatMol, a novel
approach that leverages LLMs for molecule design across diverse constraint
settings. Initially, we crafted a molecule representation compatible with LLMs
and validated its efficacy across multiple online LLMs. Afterwards, we
developed specific prompts geared towards diverse constrained molecule
generation tasks to further fine-tune current LLMs while integrating feedback
learning derived from property prediction. Finally, to address the limitations
of LLMs in numerical recognition, we referred to the position encoding method
and incorporated additional encoding for numerical values within the prompt.
Experimental results across single-property, substructure-property, and
multi-property constrained tasks demonstrate that ChatMol consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including VAE and RL-based methods.
Notably, in multi-objective binding affinity maximization task, ChatMol
achieves a significantly lower KD value of 0.25 for the protein target ESR1,
while maintaining the highest overall performance, surpassing previous methods
by 4.76%. Meanwhile, with numerical enhancement, the Pearson correlation
coefficient between the instructed property values and those of the generated
molecules increased by up to 0.49. These findings highlight the potential of
LLMs as a versatile framework for molecule generation, offering a promising
alternative to traditional latent space and RL-based approaches.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Despite recent breakthroughs in reasoning-enhanced large language models
(LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1, incorporating inference-time reasoning into machine
translation (MT), where human translators naturally employ structured,
multi-layered reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), is yet underexplored.
Existing methods either design a fixed CoT tailored for a specific MT sub-task
(e.g., literature translation), or rely on synthesizing CoTs unaligned with
humans and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) prone to catastrophic forgetting,
limiting their adaptability to diverse translation scenarios. This paper
introduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time
reasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned
CoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations:
(1) extending reasoning-based translation beyond MT sub-tasks to six languages
and diverse tasks (e.g., legal/medical domain adaptation, idiom resolution);
(2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human
strategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3)
enabling self-evolving CoT discovery and anti-forgetting adaptation through RL
with KL-constrained rewards. Experimental results indicate a steady translation
performance improvement in 21 languages and 80 translation directions on
Flores-101 test set, especially on the 15 languages unseen from training, with
its general multilingual abilities preserved compared with plain SFT.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We study self-rewarding reasoning large language models (LLMs), which can
simultaneously generate step-by-step reasoning and evaluate the correctness of
their outputs during the inference time-without external feedback. This
integrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning
process, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We
particularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models
autonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when
to terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a
two-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning
models using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential
rejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that
incorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning
models on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of
self-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the
models' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through
reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and
Qwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction
capabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on
external reward models.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Distilling large language models (LLMs) typically involves transferring the
teacher model's responses through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, this
approach neglects the potential to distill both data (output content) and
reward signals (quality evaluations). Extracting reliable reward signals
directly from teacher models is challenging, as LLMs are optimized for
generation rather than evaluation, often resulting in biased or inconsistent
assessments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel distillation
pipeline that transfers both responses and rewards. Our method generates
pseudo-rewards through a self-supervised mechanism that leverages the inherent
structure of both teacher and student responses, enabling reward learning
without explicit external evaluation. The reward model subsequently guides
reinforcement learning (RL), allowing iterative refinement of the student model
after an SFT warm-up phase. Experiments on GSM8K and MMLU-PRO demonstrate that
our method consistently outperforms traditional SFT-based approaches, enabling
student models to surpass the performance of their teachers. This work

<p class='card-text'>The language generation and reasoning capabilities of large language models

variety of tasks, from code generation, to composing essays, to passing STEM
and legal exams, to a new paradigm for knowledge search. Besides those
short-term use applications, LLMs are increasingly used to help with real-life
goals or tasks that take a long time to complete, involving multiple sessions
across days, weeks, months, or even years. Thus to enable conversational
systems for long term interactions and tasks, we need language-based agents
that can plan for long horizons. Traditionally, such capabilities were
addressed by reinforcement learning agents with hierarchical planning
capabilities. In this work, we explore a novel architecture where the LLM acts
as the meta-controller deciding the agent's next macro-action, and tool use
augmented LLM-based option policies execute the selected macro-action. We
instantiate this framework for a specific set of macro-actions enabling

rely solely on text utterances, missing implicit user traits such as
personality, speaking style, and goals. In contrast, persona-based methods lack
generalizability, as they depend on predefined profiles of famous individuals

implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from
human-machine conversations and uses them to generate more personalized and
realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a
comprehensive profile schema. Then, we refine the simulation through
conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle
consistency, optimizing it at both the utterance and conversation levels.
Finally, we adopt a diverse profile sampler to capture the distribution of
real-world user profiles. Experimental results demonstrate that USP outperforms

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to
reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather
than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward
shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a
systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying
principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive
study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key
design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid
initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best
formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we
propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent
preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for
reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and
Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.
Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward
shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at
least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR
exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward
for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even
after two full epochs of training. Code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in
aligning large language models (LLMs). Yet its reliance on a singular reward
model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches
address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune
corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning.
However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and
heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing
Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating
single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF
(MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it
log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of
each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results

3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve
rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub
issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for
medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs
like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution
data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For
example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely,
function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language
understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to
performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to
improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on
massive software engineering data.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative
multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most
previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their
innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as
shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL
(Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement
Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash
the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first
generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn
discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL
verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score
that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to
encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the
co-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike
existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of
multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by
analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs
alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast,
multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across
benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.</p>

<p class='card-text'>We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the
potential of producing high-quality classical sheet music. Inspired by the
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training,
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as
the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music, and
then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions
conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement
learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation
quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined
rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic
music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes.
Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced formal theorem
proving, yet the scarcity of high-quality training data constrains their
capabilities in complex mathematical domains. Combinatorics, a cornerstone of
mathematics, provides essential tools for analyzing discrete structures and
solving optimization problems. However, its inherent complexity makes it
particularly challenging for automated theorem proving (ATP) for combinatorial
identities. To address this, we manually construct LeanComb, combinatorial
identities benchmark in Lean, which is, to our knowledge, the first formalized
theorem proving benchmark built for combinatorial identities. We develop an
Automated Theorem Generator for Combinatorial Identities, ATG4CI, which
combines candidate tactics suggested by a self-improving large language model
with a Reinforcement Learning Tree Search approach for tactic prediction. By
utilizing ATG4CI, we generate a LeanComb-Enhanced dataset comprising 260K

<p class='card-text'>Evacuation decision prediction is critical for efficient and effective
wildfire response by helping emergency management anticipate traffic congestion
and bottlenecks, allocate resources, and minimize negative impacts. Traditional
statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the
complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work,
for the first time, we introduce FLARE, short for facilitating LLM for advanced
reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model
(LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to
streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with
memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation
decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the
limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such
as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting
individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable
mental state-behavior mapping. Experiments on three post-wildfire survey

<p class='card-text'>Increasing interest in reasoning models has led math to become a prominent
testing ground for algorithmic and methodological improvements. However,
existing open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality,
human-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of
uncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity.
In this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math
questions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning
(RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly
available datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1)
problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended,
(3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of
Big-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the
findings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with
verified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple
choice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a
systematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing
open-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order
of magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the
questions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the
dataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across
problem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties,
enabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and
training requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity,
Big-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity,
nonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative
Adversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement
learning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four
major bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key
macroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential
market properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into
actionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM)
Qwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments,
and volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of
which demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over
existing methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE
evaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation
(3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement
learning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute
Error of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond
market dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also
provides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk &
volatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a
bridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and
language model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. It requires joint training of an actor and critic with a
pretrained, fixed reward model for guidance. This approach increases
computational complexity and instability due to actor-critic interdependence.
Additionally, PPO lacks access to true environment rewards in LLM tasks,
limiting its adaptability. Under such conditions, pretraining a value model or
a reward model becomes equivalent, as both provide fixed supervisory signals
without new ground-truth feedback. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{Decoupled Value Policy Optimization (DVPO)}, a lean framework that
replaces traditional reward modeling with a pretrained \emph{global value model
(GVM)}. The GVM is conditioned on policy trajectories and predicts token-level
return-to-go estimates. By decoupling value model from policy training (via
frozen GVM-driven RL objectives), DVPO eliminates actor-critic interdependence,
reducing GPU memory usage by 40\% and training time by 35\% compared to
conventional RLHF. Experiments across benchmarks show DVPO outperforms
efficient RLHF methods (e.g., DPO) while matching state-of-the-art PPO in
performance.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The application of role-playing large language models (LLMs) is rapidly
expanding in both academic and commercial domains, driving an increasing demand
for high-precision role-playing models. Simultaneously, the rapid advancement
of reasoning techniques has continuously pushed the performance boundaries of
LLMs. This intersection of practical role-playing demands and evolving
reasoning capabilities raises an important research question: "Can reasoning
techniques enhance the role-playing capabilities of LLMs?" To address this, we
conduct a comprehensive study using 6 role-playing benchmarks, 24 LLMs, and 3
distinct role-playing strategies, comparing the effectiveness of direct
zero-shot role-playing, role-playing with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and
role-playing using reasoning-optimized LLMs. Our findings reveal that CoT may
reduce role-playing performance, reasoning-optimized LLMs are unsuitable for
role-playing, reasoning ability disrupts the role-playing scaling law, large
models still lack proficiency in advanced role-playing, and Chinese
role-playing performance surpasses English role-playing performance.
Furthermore, based on extensive experimental results, we propose two promising
future research directions: Role-aware CoT for improving role-playing LLMs and
Reinforcement Learning for role-playing LLMs, aiming to enhance the

<p class='card-text'>Recent work, spanning from autonomous vehicle coordination to in-space
assembly, has shown the importance of learning collaborative behavior for
enabling robots to achieve shared goals. A common approach for learning this
cooperative behavior is to utilize the centralized-training
decentralized-execution paradigm. However, this approach also introduces a new
challenge: how do we evaluate the contributions of each agent's actions to the
overall success or failure of the team. This credit assignment problem has
remained open, and has been extensively studied in the Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning literature. In fact, humans manually inspecting agent
behavior often generate better credit evaluations than existing methods. We
combine this observation with recent works which show Large Language Models
demonstrate human-level performance at many pattern recognition tasks. Our key
idea is to reformulate credit assignment to the two pattern recognition
problems of sequence improvement and attribution, which motivates our novel
LLM-MCA method. Our approach utilizes a centralized LLM reward-critic which
numerically decomposes the environment reward based on the individualized
contribution of each agent in the scenario. We then update the agents' policy
networks based on this feedback. We also propose an extension LLM-TACA where
our LLM critic performs explicit task assignment by passing an intermediary
goal directly to each agent policy in the scenario. Both our methods far
outperform the state-of-the-art on a variety of benchmarks, including
Level-Based Foraging, Robotic Warehouse, and our new Spaceworld benchmark which
incorporates collision-related safety constraints. As an artifact of our
methods, we generate large trajectory datasets with each timestep annotated

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated remarkable
effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
Many existing alignment approaches rely on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model
assumption, which assumes the existence of a ground-truth reward for each
prompt-response pair. However, this assumption can be overly restrictive when
modeling complex human preferences. In this paper, we drop the BT model
assumption and study LLM alignment under general preferences, formulated as a
two-player game. Drawing on theoretical insights from learning in games, we
integrate optimistic online mirror descent into our alignment framework to
approximate the Nash policy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our approach
achieves an $O(T^{-1})$ bound on the duality gap, improving upon the previous
$O(T^{-1/2})$ result. More importantly, we implement our method and show
through experiments that it outperforms state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms across

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an
influential technique, enabling the alignment of large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. Despite the promising potential of RLHF, how to protect
user preference privacy has become a crucial issue. Most previous work has
focused on using differential privacy (DP) to protect the privacy of individual
data. However, they have concentrated primarily on item-level privacy
protection and have unsatisfactory performance for user-level privacy, which is
more common in RLHF. This study proposes a novel framework, AUP-RLHF, which
integrates user-level label DP into RLHF. We first show that the classical
random response algorithm, which achieves an acceptable performance in
item-level privacy, leads to suboptimal utility when in the user-level
settings. We then establish a lower bound for the user-level label DP-RLHF and
develop the AUP-RLHF algorithm, which guarantees $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
user-level privacy and achieves an improved estimation error. Experimental
results show that AUP-RLHF outperforms existing baseline methods in sentiment

<p class='card-text'>6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and
ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and
Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet
they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing
inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this
complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use
of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing
solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their
adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a
framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a
SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented
Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the
collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates
resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for
high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level
decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The
LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered
by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management
for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the primary
method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. While
it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant
computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external
reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO)}, an alternative approach that
leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the
dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences.
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability
of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes,
architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we
investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple
responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a

Our findings demonstrate that models trained through IPO achieve performance
