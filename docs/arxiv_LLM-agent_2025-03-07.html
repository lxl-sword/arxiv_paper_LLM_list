<p class='card-text'>The latest reasoning-enhanced large language models (reasoning LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o3, have demonstrated remarkable success. However, the
application of such reasoning enhancements to the highly professional medical
domain has not been clearly evaluated, particularly regarding with not only
assessing the final generation but also examining the quality of their
reasoning processes. In this study, we present MedR-Bench, a reasoning-focused
medical evaluation benchmark comprising 1,453 structured patient cases with
reasoning references mined from case reports. Our benchmark spans 13 body
systems and 10 specialty disorders, encompassing both common and rare diseases.
In our evaluation, we introduce a versatile framework consisting of three
critical clinical stages: assessment recommendation, diagnostic
decision-making, and treatment planning, comprehensively capturing the LLMs'
performance across the entire patient journey in healthcare. For metrics, we
propose a novel agentic system, Reasoning Evaluator, designed to automate and
objectively quantify free-text reasoning responses in a scalable manner from
the perspectives of efficiency, factuality, and completeness by dynamically
searching and performing cross-referencing checks. As a result, we assess five
state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and
others. Our results reveal that current LLMs can handle relatively simple
diagnostic tasks with sufficient critical assessment results, achieving
accuracy generally over 85%. However, they still struggle with more complex
tasks, such as assessment recommendation and treatment planning. In reasoning,
their reasoning processes are generally reliable, with factuality scores
exceeding 90%, though they often omit critical reasoning steps. Our study
clearly reveals further development directions for current clinical LLMs.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Survey paper plays a crucial role in scientific research, especially given
the rapid growth of research publications. Recently, researchers have begun
using LLMs to automate survey generation for better efficiency. However, the
quality gap between LLM-generated surveys and those written by human remains
significant, particularly in terms of outline quality and citation accuracy. To
close these gaps, we introduce SurveyForge, which first generates the outline
by analyzing the logical structure of human-written outlines and referring to
the retrieved domain-related articles. Subsequently, leveraging high-quality
papers retrieved from memory by our scholar navigation agent, SurveyForge can
automatically generate and refine the content of the generated article.
Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct SurveyBench,
which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and
assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference,
outline, and content quality. Experiments demonstrate that SurveyForge can
outperform previous works such as AutoSurvey.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Model (LLM) applications, including LLM app stores and
autonomous agents, are shaping the future of AI ecosystems. However, platform
silos, fragmented hardware integration, and the absence of standardized
interfaces limit scalability, interoperability, and resource efficiency. While
LLM app stores democratize AI, their closed ecosystems restrict modular AI
reuse and cross-platform portability. Meanwhile, agent-based frameworks offer
flexibility but often lack seamless integration across diverse environments.
This paper envisions the future of LLM applications and proposes a three-layer
decoupled architecture grounded in software engineering principles such as
layered system design, service-oriented architectures, and hardware-software
co-design. This architecture separates application logic, communication
protocols, and hardware execution, enhancing modularity, efficiency, and
cross-platform compatibility. Beyond architecture, we highlight key security
and privacy challenges for safe, scalable AI deployment and outline research
directions in software and security engineering. This vision aims to foster
open, secure, and interoperable LLM ecosystems, guiding future advancements in
AI applications.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an
environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database
APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user
query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical.
However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding
the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify
these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its
importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool
documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first
method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to
discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors
and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can
generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool
description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two
straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool
testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom
tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that
many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we
show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the
prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable
AI agents.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are revolutionizing autonomous
communication and collaboration, yet they remain vulnerable to security threats
like unauthorized access and data breaches. To address this, we introduce
AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical
information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information
by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents.
AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication
by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and
HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against
unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic
defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe
significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above
80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates
scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information
complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language
Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level
semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex
behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective
reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks
where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate
design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex
HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,
a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language
task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated
environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance
feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,
creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable
text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive
simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an
ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.
Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Temporal progression is an integral part of knowledge accumulation and
update. Web search is frequently adopted as grounding for agent knowledge, yet
its inappropriate configuration affects the quality of agent responses. Here,
we construct a tool-based out-of-sample testing framework to measure the
knowledge variability of large language model (LLM) agents from distinct
date-controlled tools (DCTs). We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM
agent as a writing assistant, which can use web search to help complete
scientific publication abstracts. We show that temporal effects of the search
engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated
with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as
chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that agent evaluation should
take a dynamical view and account for the temporal influence of tools and the

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-06 07:01:36</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires
localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical
reasoning capabilities. Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based
LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical
expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge.
Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and
clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating
three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2)
Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and
intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep)
employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical
documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage
medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical
expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam
questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1%
over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining
robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative
case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL)
demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query.
KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure
documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new
framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system
significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability,
enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs

<p class='card-text'>The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for
effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities.
However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly
available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark
datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly
susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive
data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that
address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and
imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a
novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data
contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents
to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating
semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation
methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs.
Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under

<p class='card-text'>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative visual analytics
systems has transformed data-driven insights, yet significant challenges
persist in accurately interpreting users' analytical and interaction intents.
While language inputs offer flexibility, they often lack precision, making the
expression of complex intents inefficient, error-prone, and time-intensive. To
address these limitations, we investigate the design space of multimodal
interactions for generative visual analytics through a literature review and
pilot brainstorming sessions. Building on these insights, we introduce a highly
extensible workflow that integrates multiple LLM agents for intent inference
and visualization generation. We develop InterChat, a generative visual
analytics system that combines direct manipulation of visual elements with
natural language inputs. This integration enables precise intent communication
and supports progressive, visually driven exploratory data analyses. By
employing effective prompt engineering, and contextual interaction linking,
alongside intuitive visualization and interaction designs, InterChat bridges
the gap between user interactions and LLM-driven visualizations, enhancing both
interpretability and usability. Extensive evaluations, including two usage
scenarios, a user study, and expert feedback, demonstrate the effectiveness of
InterChat. Results show significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency
of handling complex visual analytics tasks, highlighting the potential of
multimodal interactions to redefine user engagement and analytical depth in

<p class='card-text'>We introduce Pok\'eChamp, a minimax agent powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) for Pok\'emon battles. Built on a general framework for two-player
competitive games, Pok\'eChamp leverages the generalist capabilities of LLMs to
enhance minimax tree search. Specifically, LLMs replace three key modules: (1)
player action sampling, (2) opponent modeling, and (3) value function
estimation, enabling the agent to effectively utilize gameplay history and
human knowledge to reduce the search space and address partial observability.
Notably, our framework requires no additional LLM training. We evaluate
Pok\'eChamp in the popular Gen 9 OU format. When powered by GPT-4o, it achieves
a win rate of 76% against the best existing LLM-based bot and 84% against the
strongest rule-based bot, demonstrating its superior performance. Even with an
open-source 8-billion-parameter Llama 3.1 model, Pok\'eChamp consistently
outperforms the previous best LLM-based bot, Pok\'ellmon powered by GPT-4o,
with a 64% win rate. Pok\'eChamp attains a projected Elo of 1300-1500 on the
Pok\'emon Showdown online ladder, placing it among the top 30%-10% of human
players. In addition, this work compiles the largest real-player Pok\'emon
battle dataset, featuring over 3 million games, including more than 500k
high-Elo matches. Based on this dataset, we establish a series of battle

<p class='card-text'>The manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by
cutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, and cloud computing. Despite these
advancements, effective system control, which is crucial for optimizing
production efficiency, remains a complex challenge due to the intricate,
knowledge-dependent nature of manufacturing processes and the reliance on
domain-specific expertise. Conventional control methods often demand heavy
customization, considerable computational resources, and lack transparency in
decision-making. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, as a straightforward, adaptable
solution for controlling manufacturing systems, specifically, mobile robot
scheduling. We introduce an LLM-based control framework to assign mobile robots
to different machines in robot assisted serial production lines, evaluating its
performance in terms of system throughput. Our proposed framework outperforms
traditional scheduling approaches such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS),
Shortest Processing Time (SPT), and Longest Processing Time (LPT). While it
achieves performance that is on par with state-of-the-art methods like
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it offers a distinct advantage by
delivering comparable throughput without the need for extensive retraining.
These results suggest that the proposed LLM-based solution is well-suited for
scenarios where technical expertise, computational resources, and financial
investment are limited, while decision transparency and system scalability are
critical concerns.</p>

<p class='card-text'>As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the
requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same
time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of
their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the
notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating
deceptive behaviors. However, evaluations of honesty are currently highly
limited, with no benchmark combining large scale and applicability to all
models. Moreover, many benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply
measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. In this
work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for measuring honesty
directly, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty for the first time.
Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher
accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, while
most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks, we find a
substantial propensity in frontier LLMs to lie when pressured to do so,
resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods,
such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These
results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective
interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.</p>

agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when
the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we
propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of
malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via
queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit
a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions
when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence
of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps.
During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt

also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the

MAS as executable code and propose a consistency-oriented data construction

  Instruction-Following in Large Language Models</a></h5>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-05 17:03:48</h6>
<p class='card-text'>We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning
approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language
Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints. While LLMs demonstrate
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain
adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn
conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs
address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with
targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate
intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing
within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs
were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test
scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct
response generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing
persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination
prevention. Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more
computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed.
These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide
effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make
decisions in complex scenarios.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability
detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul.
However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as
vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than
isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval
introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack
pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context
retrieval, limiting their practicality.
  We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each
function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879
CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation
of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging
thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than
LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies
like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both
methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or
over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p>

a planning thread driven by a centralized memory system, maintaining

<p class='card-text'>Molecular optimization is a crucial yet complex and time-intensive process
that often acts as a bottleneck for drug development. Traditional methods rely
heavily on trial and error, making multi-objective optimization both
time-consuming and resource-intensive. Current AI-based methods have shown
limited success in handling multi-objective optimization tasks, hampering their
practical utilization. To address this challenge, we present MultiMol, a
collaborative large language model (LLM) system designed to guide
multi-objective molecular optimization. MultiMol comprises two agents,
including a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent.
The data-driven worker agent is a large language model being fine-tuned to
learn how to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives,
while the literature-guided research agent is responsible for searching
task-related literature to find useful prior knowledge that facilitates
identifying the most promising optimized candidates. In evaluations across six
multi-objective optimization tasks, MultiMol significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving a 82.30% success rate, in sharp contrast to the 27.50%
success rate of current strongest methods. To further validate its practical
impact, we tested MultiMol on two real-world challenges. First, we enhanced the
selectivity of Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC), a promiscuous ligand that binds
both A1R and A2AR, successfully biasing it towards A1R. Second, we improved the
bioavailability of Saquinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with known
bioavailability limitations. Overall, these results indicate that MultiMol
represents a highly promising approach for multi-objective molecular
optimization, holding great potential to accelerate the drug development
process and contribute to the advancement of pharmaceutical research.</p>

predominantly focuses on the English language, encompassing both models and
datasets. Furthermore, the financial and temporal investments required for
crowdsourcing such datasets for finetuning are substantial, particularly when
multiple languages are involved. Fortunately, advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) have unveiled a plethora of possibilities across diverse tasks.
Specifically, instruction-tuning has enabled LLMs to execute tasks based on
natural language instructions, occasionally surpassing the performance of human
crowdworkers. Additionally, these models possess the capability to function in
various languages within a single thread. Consequently, to generate new samples
in different languages, we propose leveraging these capabilities to replicate
the data collection process. We introduce a pipeline for generating Open-Domain
Dialogue data in multiple Target Languages using LLMs, with demonstrations
provided in a unique Source Language. By eschewing explicit Machine Translation
in this approach, we enhance the adherence to language-specific nuances. We
apply this methodology to the PersonaChat dataset. To enhance the openness of

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4),
reviving the research of general autonomous agents with human-like cognitive
abilities. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and
instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of
LLMs. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level
agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture,
the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid
creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities.
Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further
leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as
multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory,
reflection and motivation. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building
engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific
autonomous agents without any programming effort.</p>

Although numerous studies have explored the legal domain in general, research
dedicated to taxation remain scarce. Moreover, the datasets used in these

benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to predict the legitimacy of
additional tax penalties. PLAT is constructed to evaluate LLMs' understanding
of tax law, particularly in cases where resolving the issue requires more than
just applying related statutes. Our experiments with six LLMs reveal that their
baseline capabilities are limited, especially when dealing with conflicting
issues that demand a comprehensive understanding. However, we found that
enabling retrieval, self-reasoning, and discussion among multiple agents with

<p class='card-text'>Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly
challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of
un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing
evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with
limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using
metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of
evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks
lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately
reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2)
Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic
similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems
above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework
for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative
evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric.
Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation
benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains,
with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the
benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of
new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages
large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a
semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically
similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive
experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability
of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly
evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing
several insightful findings.</p>

<p class='card-text'>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing
interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks. By leveraging
LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across
various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors
has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic
graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive
tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints
imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the
significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the
development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the
GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages
collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD
incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific
knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally,
knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge,
maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD
demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised
graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance
the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential
improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing
tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future
design of LLM-based predictors.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Solving mathematical problems using computer-verifiable languages like Lean
has significantly impacted mathematical and computer science communities.
State-of-the-art methods utilize single Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents

single-agent methods inherently lack a structured way to combine high-level
reasoning in Natural Language (NL) with Formal Language (FL) verification

<p class='card-text'>Large language models (LLMs), initially developed for generative AI, are now
evolving into agentic AI systems, which make decisions in complex, real-world
contexts. Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are
well-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood. This
is particularly evident when models are handling exceptions, a critical and
challenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent
incompleteness of contracts. Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that
excel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they
adhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical,
suboptimal, or even counterproductive. We then evaluate three approaches to
tuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. We find that while
ethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only
slight improvements, supervised fine-tuning, specifically with human
explanations, yields markedly better results. Surprisingly, in our experiments,
supervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like
decision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of
human-aligned decision-making across contexts. Furthermore, fine-tuning with
explanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that
aligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions
are made, not just which decisions are made. These findings highlight the need
to address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the
development of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human
