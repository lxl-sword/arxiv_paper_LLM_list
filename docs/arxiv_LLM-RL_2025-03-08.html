  Language Model Services</a></h5>
<h5 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Authors:Xiaoqi Wang, Hongyang Du, Yuehong Gao, Dong In Kim</h6>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their
widespread adoption and large-scale deployment across various domains. However,
their environmental impact, particularly during inference, has become a growing
concern due to their substantial energy consumption and carbon footprint.
Existing research has focused on inference computation alone, overlooking the
analysis and optimization of carbon footprint in network-aided LLM service
systems. To address this gap, we propose AOLO, a framework for analysis and
optimization for low-carbon oriented wireless LLM services. AOLO introduces a
comprehensive carbon footprint model that quantifies greenhouse gas emissions
across the entire LLM service chain, including computational inference and
wireless communication. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem aimed
at minimizing the overall carbon footprint, which is solved through joint
optimization of inference outputs and transmit power under
quality-of-experience and system performance constraints. To achieve this joint
optimization, we leverage the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks
(SNNs) by adopting SNN as the actor network and propose a low-carbon-oriented
optimization algorithm, i.e., SNN-based deep reinforcement learning (SDRL).
Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that SDRL algorithm significantly reduces
overall carbon footprint, achieving an 18.77% reduction compared to the
benchmark soft actor-critic, highlighting its potential for enabling more
sustainable LLM inference services.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language
Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level
semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex
behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective
reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks
where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate
design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex
HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,
a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language
task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated
environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance
feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,
creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable
text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive
simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an
ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.
Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-05 20:43:49</h6>
<p class='card-text'>The manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by
cutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, and cloud computing. Despite these
advancements, effective system control, which is crucial for optimizing
production efficiency, remains a complex challenge due to the intricate,
knowledge-dependent nature of manufacturing processes and the reliance on
domain-specific expertise. Conventional control methods often demand heavy
customization, considerable computational resources, and lack transparency in
decision-making. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, as a straightforward, adaptable
solution for controlling manufacturing systems, specifically, mobile robot
scheduling. We introduce an LLM-based control framework to assign mobile robots
to different machines in robot assisted serial production lines, evaluating its
performance in terms of system throughput. Our proposed framework outperforms
traditional scheduling approaches such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS),
Shortest Processing Time (SPT), and Longest Processing Time (LPT). While it
achieves performance that is on par with state-of-the-art methods like
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it offers a distinct advantage by
delivering comparable throughput without the need for extensive retraining.
These results suggest that the proposed LLM-based solution is well-suited for
scenarios where technical expertise, computational resources, and financial
investment are limited, while decision transparency and system scalability are
critical concerns.</p>

<p class='card-text'>This paper describes the construction of a dataset and the evaluation of
training methods to improve generative large language models' (LLMs) ability to
answer queries on sensitive topics with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), i.e.,
to provide significantly more informative, diverse and impartial answers. The
dataset, the SHQ-NPOV dataset, comprises 300 high-quality, human-written
quadruplets: a query on a sensitive topic, an answer, an NPOV rating, and a set
of links to source texts elaborating the various points of view. The first key
contribution of this paper is a new methodology to create such datasets through
iterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training, which we
release alongside the dataset. The second key contribution is the
identification of a highly effective training regime for parameter-efficient
reinforcement learning (PE-RL) to improve NPOV generation. We compare and
extensively evaluate PE-RL and multiple baselines-including LoRA finetuning (a
strong baseline), SFT and RLHF.
  PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest
baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on
features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best
answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details,
$68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative
analysis corroborates this. Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical
differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and
those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our
approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving
complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an
Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance,
and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences
is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward
functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges
through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent,
inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human
feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our
approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision
avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm
policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining
fairness and performance consistency.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in task-oriented applications, yet building emotionally
intelligent chatbots that can engage in natural, strategic conversations
remains a challenge. We present a novel approach called SAGE that uses latent
variables to control long-horizon behavior in dialogue generation. At the core
of our method is the State-Action Chain (SAC), which augments standard language
model fine-tuning by introducing latent variables that encapsulate emotional
states and conversational strategies between dialogue turns. During inference,
these variables are generated before each response, enabling coarse-grained
control over dialogue progression while maintaining natural interaction
patterns. We also introduce a self-improvement pipeline that leverages dialogue
tree search, LLM-based reward modeling, and targeted fine-tuning to optimize
conversational trajectories. Our experimental results show that models trained
with this approach demonstrate improved performance in emotional intelligence
metrics while maintaining strong capabilities on LLM benchmarks. The discrete
nature of our latent variables facilitates search-based strategies and provides
a foundation for future applications of reinforcement learning to dialogue
systems, where learning can occur at the state level rather than the token

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language
models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards
developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models
without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning
algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling
and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored.
Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we
investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on
behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly
available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform
corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in
the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the
attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference
dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This
manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the
misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack
can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted
domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities
of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the
RLHF fine-tuning process.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 17:57:09</h6>
<p class='card-text'>In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial
importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO).
However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response
are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation.
The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens
or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow
convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an
RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization.
Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective
and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a
token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly
combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we
further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the
pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a
reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different
tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct
an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and
showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward
optimization.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-03-04 05:39:24</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit a memorization phenomenon
in code generation: instead of truly understanding the underlying principles of
a programming problem, they tend to memorize the original prompt and its
solution together in the training. Consequently, when facing variants of the
original problem, their answers very likely resemble the memorized solutions
and fail to generalize. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by
designing three evolution strategies to create variants: mutation,
paraphrasing, and code-rewriting. By comparing the performance and AST
similarity of the LLM-generated codes before and after these three evolutions,
we develop a memorization score that positively correlates with the level of
memorization. As expected, as supervised fine-tuning goes on, the memorization
score rises before overfitting, suggesting more severe memorization. We
demonstrate that common mitigation approaches, such as prompt translation and
using evolved variants as data augmentation in supervised learning and
reinforcement learning, either compromise the performance or fail to alleviate
the memorization issue. Therefore, memorization remains a significant challenge
in LLM code generation, highlighting the need for a more effective solution.</p>

VC-PPO, the value model is pretrained to tackle initialization bias, and the
Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) computation is decoupled between the

Specifically, we develop a two-stage joint optimization process that integrates
imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and design an off-policy joint

<p class='card-text'>The alignment of large language models with human values presents a critical
challenge, particularly when balancing conflicting objectives like helpfulness
and harmlessness. Existing approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), face notable
limitations: RLHF suffers from instability and inefficiency in multi-objective
optimization, while DPO lacks mechanisms for dynamic trade-offs. To address
these challenges, we propose Post-Training Extrapolation Optimization (PEO), a
novel and efficient framework for bi-factorial alignment. PEO generates a
family of Pareto-optimal policies in a single training pass by leveraging a
three-phase pipeline: (1) aspect-specific learning, (2) generalist
initialization via interpolation, and (3) post-training optimization via
extrapolation. PEO enables dynamic adaptation to diverse user preferences at
inference time without retraining. Our comprehensive experiments across
multiple LLMs demonstrate that PEO achieves superior Pareto fronts compared to
baselines, offering improved flexibility and computational efficiency.
Theoretical analyses further highlight PEO's capacity to overcome optimization

CE-U (Cross Entropy Unlearning), a novel loss function designed specifically

approaches which suffer from instability due to vanishing gradients when model
confidence is high and gradient exploding when confidence is low. We also unify
standard cross entropy supervision and cross entropy unlearning into a single
framework. Notably, on the TOFU benchmark for unlearning \cite{maini2024tofu},
CE-U achieves state-of-the-art results on LLaMA2-7B with 1\% and 5\%
forgetting, even without the use of any extra reference model or additional

instability issues also exist in popular reinforcement learning algorithms like
DPO \cite{rafailov2023direct} and GRPO\cite{Shao2024DeepSeekMath}, as they

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has evolved to be one of
the main methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). However,
existing RLHF methods are non-robust, and their performance deteriorates if the
downstream task differs significantly from the preference dataset used in
fine-tuning. In order to mitigate this problem, we introduce a distributionally
robust RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs. In particular, our goal is to ensure that a
fine-tuned model retains its performance even when the distribution of prompts
significantly differs from the distribution encountered during fine-tuning. We
formulate distributionally robust optimization (DRO) version of two popular
fine-tuning methods -- (1) reward-based RLHF and (2) reward-free DPO (direct
preference optimization). We propose a minibatch gradient descent based
algorithms for both of them, and theoretically prove convergence guarantees for
the algorithms. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms on an
out-of-distribution (OOD) task by first training the model on the
Unified-Feedback dataset and evaluating its performance on two different
datasets. The experimental results show that our robust training improves the
accuracy of the learned reward models on average, and markedly on some tasks,
such as reasoning. Furthermore, we show that the robust versions of policy
optimization methods, similarly improve performance on OOD tasks.</p>

<p class='card-text'>The adaptivity and maneuvering capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
(AUVs) have drawn significant attention in oceanic research, due to the
unpredictable disturbances and strong coupling among the AUV's degrees of
freedom. In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced
reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs.
Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller
parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and
structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance
multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In
the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting
task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts
into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and
unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme
sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed
controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level
tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming
traditional PID and SMC controllers.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Recent advancements in instruction fine-tuning, alignment methods such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and optimization techniques
like direct preference optimization (DPO) have significantly enhanced the
adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to user preferences. However,
despite these innovations, many LLMs continue to exhibit biases toward Western,
Anglo-centric, or American cultures, with performance on English data
consistently surpassing that of other languages. This reveals a persistent
cultural gap in LLMs, which complicates their ability to accurately process
culturally rich and diverse figurative language such as proverbs. To address
this, we introduce Jawaher, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs' capacity to
comprehend and interpret Arabic proverbs. Jawaher includes proverbs from
various Arabic dialects, along with idiomatic translations and explanations.
Through extensive evaluations of both open- and closed-source models, we find
that while LLMs can generate idiomatically accurate translations, they struggle
with producing culturally nuanced and contextually relevant explanations. These
findings highlight the need for ongoing model refinement and dataset expansion
to bridge the cultural gap in figurative language processing.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-28 22:16:42</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Information retrieval systems are crucial for enabling effective access to
large document collections. Recent approaches have leveraged Large Language
Models (LLMs) to enhance retrieval performance through query augmentation, but
often rely on expensive supervised learning or distillation techniques that
require significant computational resources and hand-labeled data. In this
paper, we introduce DeepRetrieval, a novel reinforcement learning-based
approach that trains LLMs to perform query augmentation directly through trial
and error, without requiring supervised data. By using the retrieval recall as
a reward signal, our system learns to generate effective queries that maximize
document retrieval performance. Our preliminary results demonstrate that
DeepRetrieval significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
including the recent LEADS system, achieving 60.82\% recall on publication
search and 70.84\% recall on trial search tasks while using a smaller model (3B
vs. 7B parameters) and requiring no supervision data. These results suggest
that our reinforcement learning approach offers a more efficient and effective
paradigm for information retrieval, potentially changing the landscape of
document retrieval systems. code is available at

<p class='card-text'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the natural language processing
landscape and brought to life diverse applications. Pretraining on vast
web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research
community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to
achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic
foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge,
improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with
user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,
and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs
performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various
real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of
post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond
pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward
hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in
model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline
future research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually
track developments in this fast-evolving field:

<p class='card-text'>Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs).
To amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context
training, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data
partitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training
frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish
static communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a
2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no
matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch
between data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and
imbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.
  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable
LLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short
sequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid
Data Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning
with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,
which eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware
sharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication
cost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a
balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware
data assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to
141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more
than 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the
state-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.</p>

<p class='card-text'>Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for LLM alignment and
reasoning, but existing policy-based methods, such as PPO and DPO, can fall
short of fixing shortcuts inherited from pre-training. In this work, we
introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides
the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to
learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online
dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using
unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably
learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically,
$Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while
maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we
establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning,
providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability.
Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and
converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our
results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs,
offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees. The code can be
found at https://github.com/jinpz/q_sharp.</p>

<h6 class='card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted'>Date:2025-02-27 14:19:45</h6>
<p class='card-text'>Mainstream issue-resolving frameworks predominantly rely on commercial
models, leading to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing training
approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to
fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose Subtask-oriented
Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT), a novel training approach to enhance the issue
resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured
subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code
edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using
ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) rule-based reinforcement
learning, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the
SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve
21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B). The experimental
results demonstrate that SoRFT significantly enhances issue-resolving
performance, improves model generalization, and provides a cost-efficient
alternative to commercial models.</p>
